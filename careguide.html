            <h2>Watering 💧</h2>
            <p>Check the soil moisture before watering. Stick your finger an inch or two into the soil. If it's dry, it’s time to water. Most plants prefer to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.</p>

            <h2>Sunlight ☀️</h2>
            <p>Different plants have different needs. Some thrive in bright, direct light (like succulents), while others prefer indirect or low light (like ferns). Know your plant's specific needs and place it in the right spot.</p>

            <h2>Fertilizing 🌱</h2>
            <p>Feed your plants during their active growing season, which is typically spring and summer. Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer, and follow the instructions on the package to avoid over-fertilizing.</p>

            <h2>Pruning & Repotting ✂️</h2>
            <p>Trim off any dead or yellowing leaves to encourage new growth. When your plant outgrows its pot (roots are circling the bottom), it’s time to move it to a slightly larger one.</p>

            <h2>Pests 🐛</h2>
            <p>Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, spider mites, or mealybugs. If you spot them, you can often treat the plant with a gentle insecticidal soap or a neem oil solution.</p>

        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Soil & Potting 🪴</h2>
            <p>Never use garden soil for potted plants. Garden soil is dense and can compact in a pot, leading to poor drainage and root rot. A quality potting mix is a sterile, soilless blend designed to be lightweight, well-draining, and aerated</p>
