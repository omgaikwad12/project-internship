  <h1>ðŸŒ± Plant Care Guide - FAQs</h1>
  <div class="faq-container">

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">1. How often should I water my indoor plants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Instead of watering on a strict schedule, check the soil moisture. For most plants, a good rule of thumb is to water thoroughly when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. Succulents and cacti prefer to dry out completely, while tropical plants like ferns enjoy consistently moist soil. Reduce watering during the winter when plant growth naturally slows down.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">2. What is the best light for houseplants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Most common houseplants thrive in bright, indirect light, like that from an east-facing window or a few feet from a south or west-facing window. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves of many tropical plants. If a plant becomes "leggy" (long stems with few leaves), it likely needs more light. Low-light plants can tolerate north-facing windows or rooms with less sun.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">3. How do I know if my plant needs repotting?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Key signs include roots growing out of the pot's drainage holes, water running straight through without absorbing, or the plant looking too large for its container. It's also a good idea to repot if the soil is old and compacted. Choose a new pot that is only 1-2 inches larger in diameter, as too much extra space can lead to root rot.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">4. What soil is best for indoor plants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A high-quality, all-purpose potting mix is suitable for most houseplants. These mixes are designed to provide good drainage, aeration, and nutrients. For specific plants like succulents and cacti, use a special mix with more sand or perlite for faster drainage. For orchids, use a chunky bark mix. Avoid using garden soil, which is too dense and can contain pests.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">5. Why are my plant leaves turning yellow?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yellow leaves are a common sign of overwatering, which is the most frequent cause. However, it can also indicate underwatering, a nutrient deficiency, pests, or lack of light. Check the soil moisture first; if it's soggy, you're overwatering. If it's bone dry, it may be underwatering. Old leaves at the bottom of the plant also naturally turn yellow and fall off as part of the aging process.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">6. Can I grow plants in low light?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely! While no plant can survive in complete darkness, many are adapted to low-light conditions. Excellent choices include the Snake Plant (Sansevieria), ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia), Pothos (Epipremnum aureum), and Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum). These hardy plants are perfect for offices, north-facing rooms, or hallways with limited natural light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">7. How do I fertilize houseplants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Fertilizing provides essential nutrients that are depleted from the soil over time. During the growing season (spring and summer), feed your plants with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half-strength every 4-6 weeks. It's best to fertilize after watering to avoid burning the roots. In fall and winter, most plants are dormant, so you should reduce or stop fertilizing altogether.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">8. How do I prevent pests on indoor plants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Prevention is key. Regularly inspect your plants, including the undersides of leaves, for common pests like spider mites, aphids, or mealybugs. Wiping leaves with a damp cloth helps keep them clean and pest-free. If you find pests, isolate the plant and treat it with a gentle solution like neem oil or insecticidal soap to avoid spreading.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">9. Why are the tips of my plant leaves turning brown?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Brown, crispy leaf tips are most often a sign of low humidity in the air. This is very common in homes with central heating or air conditioning. Other causes can be inconsistent watering, mineral buildup from tap water, or too much fertilizer. Try misting your plant, using a humidifier, or placing it on a pebble tray with water to increase local humidity.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">10. Whatâ€™s the easiest plant for beginners?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">For those new to plant care, it's best to start with something forgiving. The Snake Plant is nearly indestructible and tolerates low light and infrequent watering. Pothos is another great choice that grows quickly and tells you when it's thirsty by drooping. Aloe Vera and Spider Plants are also very resilient and easy to propagate, making them rewarding for beginners.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">11. Should I mist my plants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Misting provides a temporary humidity boost, which is beneficial for tropical plants like ferns, calatheas, and marantas, especially in dry environments. However, the effects are short-lived. For a more consistent solution, it's better to use a humidifier or group plants together. Avoid misting plants with fuzzy leaves, like African violets, as this can cause spotting.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">12. How do I prune houseplants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Pruning helps maintain a plant's shape, removes unhealthy growth, and encourages a fuller appearance. Always use clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears to prevent disease. Trim any dead, brown, or yellow leaves at the base. To encourage bushier growth on vining plants like pothos, cut the stem just above a leaf node (where a leaf meets the stem).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">13. Can indoor plants clean the air?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, research has shown that houseplants can help purify indoor air by absorbing common household toxins like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene. Plants like the Peace Lily, Snake Plant, Spider Plant, and Pothos are particularly effective. While you would need many plants to significantly impact air quality, they are a beautiful and natural way to contribute to a healthier home environment.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">14. How can I increase humidity for my plants?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Many popular houseplants are native to humid, tropical environments. To replicate this, you can use a small room humidifier, which is the most effective method. Alternatively, you can place your plant on a tray filled with pebbles and a little water (a humidity tray). Grouping your plants together also helps, as they release moisture through transpiration, creating a humid microclimate.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">15. Do plants need special pots?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">The most important feature of any pot is a drainage hole at the bottom. This allows excess water to escape, which is crucial for preventing root rot. While materials like terracotta are porous and help soil dry faster, plastic or glazed ceramic pots retain moisture longer. If you fall in love with a decorative pot that has no holes, you can use it as a "cachepot" by placing a smaller nursery pot inside it.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">16. How do I propagate my plant?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Propagation is creating new plants from an existing one. A common method is taking stem cuttings from vining plants like Pothos or Philodendron and placing them in water until roots form. For Spider Plants, you can simply plant the "spiderettes" that hang off the mother plant. Succulents can often be propagated from a single healthy leaf placed on top of the soil.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">17. Why are my plantâ€™s leaves drooping?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Drooping is a plant's way of signaling stress, most commonly due to thirst. Check the soil, and if it's dry, a thorough watering should cause the leaves to perk up within a few hours. Paradoxically, overwatering can also cause drooping because the waterlogged roots can no longer absorb moisture effectively. Other potential causes include temperature shock, repotting stress, or too much direct sunlight.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">18. Can plants survive with only artificial light?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, many plants can grow and thrive exclusively under artificial light, making it possible to have plants in windowless rooms. Standard light bulbs are not sufficient; you need to use "grow lights" designed for plants. Full-spectrum LED grow lights are energy-efficient and provide the necessary light waves for photosynthesis. Position the light about 6-12 inches above the plant for 12-16 hours a day.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">19. How do I care for succulents?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Succulents are desert plants that store water in their leaves, so their care is different from other houseplants. They need lots of bright, direct light, so a south-facing window is ideal. Use a fast-draining cactus or succulent soil mix. The most important rule is to avoid overwatering; let the soil dry out completely between waterings, as they are highly susceptible to root rot.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">20. Why is my plant growing slowly?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Slow growth can be normal, especially during the fall and winter when most plants enter a dormant period. However, if it's the growing season, it could indicate a problem. The most common causes are insufficient light, a lack of nutrients in the soil, or being root-bound in a pot that is too small. Assess your plant's lighting conditions and consider fertilizing or repotting if needed.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">21. Can I put my indoor plants outside?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, many houseplants enjoy a summer vacation outdoors, but you must acclimate them slowly to prevent shock. Start by placing them in a shady, protected spot for just a few hours a day. Gradually increase their exposure to outdoor conditions over a week or two. Direct sunlight can easily burn leaves that are accustomed to indoor light, so be very careful.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">22. What are the signs of overwatering?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Overwatering is the number one killer of houseplants. The most common signs include yellowing lower leaves, soft or mushy stems near the soil line, and soil that never seems to dry out. You might also notice a musty smell from the soil or fungus gnats flying around the pot. Always check the soil moisture with your finger before adding more water.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">23. Whatâ€™s the difference between annuals and perennials?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">The terms describe a plant's life cycle. Annuals are plants that grow, flower, produce seeds, and die all within one growing season. You have to replant them every year. Perennials are plants that live for three or more years. Their foliage may die back to the ground in winter, but their root systems remain alive and send up new growth each spring.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">24. Do plants sleep at night?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">In a way, yes. Plants don't "sleep" like humans, but they do have a daily cycle of activity and rest called a circadian rhythm. During the day, they focus on photosynthesis (creating energy from light). At night, without light, they switch to respiration, where they use that stored energy for growth and repair. Some plants, like prayer plants, even fold up their leaves at night.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">25. How do I choose the right plant for my home?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">The key to success is matching a plant to your specific environment. First, assess the amount of natural light your space receives. Then, consider your own habitsâ€”are you attentive, or do you need a plant that thrives on neglect? Finally, think about space, humidity, and whether you have pets (as some plants are toxic). Starting with an easy-care plant that suits your light conditions is the best path to success.</div>
